the project has missing files duel to the data change from hard-drive to Github and as
a result there is a need to recreate come of the files that it needs but it not all bad
this means a chance to made changes the may be positive, though i should say i plan on maintaining
the old file structure restructure

i was thinking i would get started on the data base structure, below is a list of the changes
that i plan on taking:

    *the list items are called items, items this are going to be groups into years then a sub section of months
    and every month of the years is going to have its own items, once an item for a month is created it will be set on that
    day, i do not plan on adding functionality for set items to a specific days but have the system keep its own balances and checks
    to this.

    *we need to keep track of all the money that we are  spending each month, so we have an allocated budget, and when an
    item is created its properties will include name description and the amount allocated to that item

    *items are also grouped into checked and unchecked items to keep track of what we have already done and what still remains
    to be done.

	* updated the old damaged files with saved project files from Hard drive, this is good, it means i do not need to write so
	  many lines of code that i was dreading to do.
